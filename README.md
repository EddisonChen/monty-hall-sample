This is a simulation of the Monty Hall problem. 

The Monty Hall problem involves 3 doors. 1 Has a prize behind it, and the other 2 doors have nothing behind them.

You select a door randomly, and the host opens a different door that has nothing behind it (The host knows what is behind each door and will only open an empty door).

At this point, you can choose to either stay on the door you previously selected, or switch to the other door.

The majority of people choose to stay, assuming that it makes no difference whether you choose to switch or not.

However, the probability of winning if you switch is actually 67%, and 33% if you stay.

Using Python, this application simulates the probability of winning based on if you always stay or always switch, ran 10,000 times.
